To run, in this folder, simply type:

"./minershell"

To recompile, in this folder type:

"make"
"make minershell"

Then run:
"./minershell"

You will be prompted with the minershell prompt:
minersh$ <type_command_here>

Enter a command and click enter when done (just like a regular shell).
When you want to exit, enter "exit".

Specify redirections using the ">" or "<". A file name must also follow the symbols otherwise an error will be printed to the screen.

The shell also supports piping of multiple commands. Use '|' to pipe commands. '|' can not exist at the beginning or end of a line.
